# World Clock
### A clone of the old-fashion Clock app from Apple with the analogic rotative clocks.

This repository contains a project that I realized for an interview. It demonstrates how to use NSRunLoop to avoid the clock animation to stop while the user scroll the table view. It also shows how to use CoreAnimation to build a clock.

The project has been code entirely using Objective-C and the Cocoatouch SDK, only exception is the database which managed via MagicalRecords which can be downloaded via Cocoapods.
